It is now later! I have made up my mind. I do not like SuperCollider as much as I like ChucK.

I find the readability a bit too rough around the edges for myself. ChucK reminds me of Python while SuperCollider reminds me of Haskell.

So I will no longer be learning more of SuperCollider but delving deeper into ChucK.
