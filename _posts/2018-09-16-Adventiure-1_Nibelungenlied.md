Hallo,

Line 1 of Adventiure 1 opens up with "In Alten Geschichten" in old history "wird uns vieles Wunderbare berichtet" we have us a very wonderful story. Which in translation is very interesting to chew on. This piece of literature was from around 1200 AD and has no author attached to it. The interesting thought here is that it has no author, only translation authors (who leave their mark on the translation). This lack of an author creates an aura of mysteriousness around the story, for example if you read the works of Goethe or Schiller you can get a sense for the writing style and can feel out the story. But here that is missing, I feel as if you can only look at it as an epic.

Moving forward with Adventiure 1, it is the introduction of glorious heroes, from hard disputes, from jolly days and fests, from pain and action, from battles with braver warriors. The description of Burgundy which grows the most elegant lady, who is the most beautiful in any land of the world. The lady Kriemhild, and because of her many heroes will lose their lives.

She cares for her 3 elegant, mighty, heroic brothers. Gunther, Gernot and Giselher. They are the origin of great deeds in the land of Etzel (Atilla). They held the servitude of a great many knights until death. The list of names continues with many great heroes who follow the 3 brothers.

Kriemhild then dreams of a beautiful falcon, whom she raised to be strong and wild. Yet, it is torn apart by two eagles. Whom her mother Ãœte warned her that it meant she would lose a most noble man. Kriemhild then rebels at this thought of a man. She wants to never be "damit ich niemals durch die Liebe zu einem Mann Leid erfahre." To never suffer the love of a man, to keep her beauty. However, despite all of this. She eventually will marry an elegant man, whom she will lose and then man shall feel her wrath.

This chapter sets the tone of the rest of the book. It tells of the characters and the tragedy that will come. The first time I read this, my Professor highlighted this last bit. This made me sit in suspense as the man of glory came into view, getting to know him, until his untimely death.
