Hallo,

Chapter 2 goes over the great Siegfried from Niederland oder the Netherlands. He is a royal prince son of Siegmund and Sieglind. Many ladies hoped to see him. He learned from the finest men of the court, this molded him with the ability to win all hearts. Many people, native and stranger alike were knighted. Four-hundred knights were with Siegfried. The mass was sung to the glory of God and the chivalric party with its splendor was never seen again.
