Alright, so outside of re-reading *Das Nibelungenlied* it would be good practice to also further my knowledge in Programming. I chose [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) despite focusing my senior research project on [ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/). I am looking into with hopes for a more sequence focused language. Otherwise, I will have to develop my own sequencing algorithm in ChucK. To learn more about SuperCollider I will first follow [this tutorial](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/Getting-Started/00-Getting-Started-With-SC.html).
