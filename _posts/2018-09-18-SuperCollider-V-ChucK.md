So I went through the brief [tutorial](http://doc.sccode.org/Tutorials/Getting-Started/00-Getting-Started-With-SC.html) on [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/).

I went through each section and labeled the examples as follows.

SuperCollider is a very robust language and has been around since 1996. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCollider) Now the thing that pulls my chain the most about the language is the sheer size of the learning curve. While following the tutorial, I experimented with-in the boundaries of reason on the example code lines. It is reminiscent of the times I spent struggling with C in my Computer Organization and Operating Systems courses in Undergrad. The readability of the language itself was not the easiest and the documentation is very well detailed (too detailed).

ChucK on the other hand, is more simplistic and easier to read. However, it is a lot newer of a language (circa 2008). [2](http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~gewang/thesis.html) So that could explain some of the more quality of life features.

So moving forward I hope to experiment more with SuperCollider and will post more later!
