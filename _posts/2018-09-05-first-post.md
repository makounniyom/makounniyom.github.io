Hello World. This will be my first blog post on this site, I believe I have completed all of the basics when it comes to programming this site. I just have to change some logos (maybe?) and start writing blog posts.

From hence forth my blog posts should consist of Computer Science or German (Deutsch) related topics/books/ideas/etc. I have read or come across. I believe my first project to tackle would be to re-read some material from my German courses. I have to decide between Das Nibelungenlied oder Faust von Goethe.

Guten Nacht oder Good night.
