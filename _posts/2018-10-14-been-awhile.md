Hello World. I have not posted in a while, nor do I know if anyone even looks at these. However, I have been busy with work and life. etc. etc. I have been playing around with programming a sequencer in ChucK but I think there is one built into the language. Nibelungenlied has been collecting dust on my desk and nightstand. (Sadly).

I recently attended an [event](https://hacksandhops.com/) by FRSecure (Cybersecurity firm), I was recommended to go to it by my friend and fellow Saint John's Alumnus John Williams. The event was titled "AMBUSHED! Inside the mind of a hacker" with the speaking panel being White Hat Hackers for FRSecure. The whole talk was highly interesting and I felt that it made my mind think more on Cybersecurity. All-in-all it was not too bad to digest and pretty fun.
