In accordance with my last post on September 5, 2018 I have made up my mind to re-read *Das Nibelungenlied*.

Heir ist Band 1:

Hier ist Band2:

I first read this story (most of Band 1 and a bit of Band 2) in the fall semester of 2016 in a German course titled "*Medieval Maids/Myths/Miracles*". The course was very interesting to say the least, we read epics and poems from ancient Germany and learned some architectural history.

From what I remember of *Das Nibelungenlied* is that it survived the great purging of barbaric literature during the roman times and it was published anonymously. Part 1 or "Band 1" highlights the Burgundian kingdom and their adventures with the great Siegfried. Part 2 or "Band 2" goes over the Kriemhild and her time with Etzel the king of the Huns.

I have also purchased and downloaded an electronic version of [the Nibelungenlied](http://a.co/d/3vtdIS7) to compare the English translation. I will summarize each chapter and discuss them.

So long for now,
