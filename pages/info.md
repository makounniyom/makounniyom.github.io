To reiterate my brief description, "This website is to explore ideas and concepts for Computer Science and German. The pursuit of knowledge and betterment." To delve deeper into "ideas and concepts for Computer Science and German"; I majored in Computer Science at CSBSJU and minored in German. I seek the pathways to greater knowledge outside of undergrad, a journey of my own volition. The blog posts will have content revolving around topics in Computer Science and German, mostly separate from one another.
